# This is the technical test for JG Ingenieros

Although the test specifies "Vue Frontend Developer" as I mentioned during the interview, I have never used Vue, so instead I've done it using React, as it a library that I have some knowledge of.

I've would have tried to do it with Vue, but in just a week I don't think I've could have learnt enough to do a good job.

For both products and users I have used dummyJSON files (https://dummyjson.com/products & https://dummyjson.com/users). Any user from the users file should work to log in the application.
