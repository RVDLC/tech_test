# This is the technical test for JG Ingenieros

## A brief disclaimer

Although the test specifies "Vue Frontend Developer", as I mentioned during the interview, I have never used or seen any Vue application, so instead I've done it using React as it's a library that I have some experience working in.

I've would have tried to do it with Vue, but in just a week I don't think I've could have learnt enough to do a good job.

## Application notes

For both products and users I have used dummyJSON files (https://dummyjson.com/products & https://dummyjson.com/users).
Any user from the users file should work to log in the application.

Css is not my forte, so I've done it the best I could to make it look nice and functional.

You can both add and remove items from the cart by entering on the details of the products on its respective zones. To add it go to the details from the product list, to remove it go to the details from the cart list.
